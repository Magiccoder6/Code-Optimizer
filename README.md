# Code-Optimizer
In this collaborative project, groups of programmers implement a
code optimization tool based on finite automata and regular expressions. The primary goal is to
develop a system that takes code written in a simple programming language and optimizes it by
identifying and applying various code transformations. The project will involve multiple stages,
including lexical and syntax analysis, code optimization using finite automata-based algorithms,
and the generation of an optimized intermediate code.
